# SLAM

Thesis:

Robot navigates a predefined path on a 2d grid, determining the map and its location on the map.

Requirements:

- A 2d grid with some landmarks.
- We will assume perfect data association to begin with.
- The robot will navigate a square path using control inputs.
- We will artificially add sensor noise to both control inputs and range-bearing sensor measurements.
- The robot performs SLAM and we illustrate the robotâ€™s belief about its pose and the landmark locations on the map.
